## Plugin Code Evolution

The way in which Joomla plugins work has evolved through Versions 3, 4 and 5. There are now good explanations and examples in the Joomla Programmers Documentation [reproduced here](jdocmanual?article=docus/plugins/how-plugins-work) from the [original source](https://manual.joomla.org/docs/building-extensions/plugins/how-plugins-work/).

The remaining articles in this section are older examples that need revision!
