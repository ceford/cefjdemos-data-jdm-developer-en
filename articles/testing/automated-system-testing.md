## Background

System testing is an aid to quality control. How this is accomplished in Joomla has evolved in recent years. These are the current best places to look for information:

- The [Joomla Cypress](https://github.com/joomla-projects/joomla-cypress) project is a support package that helps in writing end-to-end tests for the Joomla CMS and its extensions with the frontend testing tool Cypress. The Joomla default branch and all active development branches are supported.
- The [JBT â€“ Joomla Branches Tester](https://github.com/muhme/joomla-branches-tester) explains how to use a Docker container to test different Joomla Versions with different databases and PHP versions.
- A [Magazine Article](https://magazine.joomla.org/all-issues/june/end-to-end-testing-with-joomla-and-cypress) describes *End-to-end testing with Joomla! and Cypress*.
