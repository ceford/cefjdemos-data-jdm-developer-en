## Integrated Development Environments

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides a comprehensive suite of tools to facilitate software development. It typically includes:

1. **Code Editor**: A text editor optimized for writing code, often with features like syntax highlighting and code completion.
2. **Compiler/Interpreter**: Tools to translate and execute code.
3. **Debugger**: A tool to find and fix errors in the code.
4. **Build Automation Tools**: Utilities to streamline the compilation and deployment process.
5. **Version Control Integration**: Support for tools like Git to manage code changes.
6. **Additional Features**: Features such as plugins, testing tools, and visual design components.

IDEs aim to streamline development by combining these tools in a unified interface, reducing the need to switch between different applications. Examples include Visual Studio and Eclipse.

## IDEs Used by Joomla Contributors

You can get started with an IDE very quickly. However, they often have a bewildering array of functions and settings that take a long time to learn. Once learned, it is not so easy to change! The following IDEs can be used on Linux, Mac and Windows.

### Visual Studio Code and VSCodium

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free IDE available for all platforms. [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is a derivative free of tracking code. Use one or both at the same time. If in doubt, install one or other or both of these packages.

### PhpStorm

PhpStorm is a commercial product favoured by professional developers. Available from [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), it has a 30 day free trial period followed by a range of prices depending on user type.

### NetBeans

[Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) ...

### Eclipse PDT

[Eclipse PHP Development Tools](https://eclipse.dev/pdt/) is free and good but its development has lagged a little.
