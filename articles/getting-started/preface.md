## About This Manual

For many years Joomla documentation was maintained in a MediaWiki installation (docs.joomla.org). Around 2020 it became clear that something better was required, with a proper table of contents and smart search feature. Two potential solutions emerged at about the same time. This manual (*Jdocmanual* or JDM), which uses a custom Joomla component, and the *Joomla! Programmers Documentation* (the JPD) which uses Docusaurus. The latter is maintained by the Joomla core developers and is likely to be the most up-to-date and accurate documentation for developers.

Jdocmanual contains articles aimed at Joomla Users and the Help pages. They are not present in the JDP, which has been imported here to create a more comprehensive Manual. This section of Jdocmanual is changing to a become a supplement to the JPD. It will contain articles for less experienced users and items not present in the JPD.
